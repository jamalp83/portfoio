### Hi, I'm Jamal Pryor and I'm a newby to the Web Development world. I currently manage a team of ATM Software Support Engineers and deploy code to 15,000 machines nationwide. My hopes from taking this course is to build a foundation in app development and acquire the knowledge to execute an application idea I've been pondering for well over a year. The journey has just begun.

### If you ever need someone to bounce an idea off of or just chat, don't hesitate to reach out.
