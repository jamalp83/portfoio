                    <p>“Sunshine” is synonymous with African drumming and dancing in East St. Louis.</p>
                    
                    <p>The nickname belongs to Sylvester Lee, who studied under legendary dancer and anthropologist Katherine Dunham before starting his own ensemble 40 years ago. He has taught thousands of children about their African roots and helped instill ethnic pride in a community that has faced its share of challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>“I’ve taught five generations,” said Lee, who grew up in East St. Louis and now lives in Belleville. “I can tell you so many success stories. We’ve had teachers, superintendents, doctors and lawyers come out of this organization. We’ve had five dance companies come out of it.”</p>
                    
                    <p>Lee is 65 now, and some might expect him to be slowing down, but that’s not the case. He holds rehearsals two nights a week, leads workshops throughout the Midwest and travels with his Community Performance Ensemble, jembe drums in tow. Last year, they performed in Israel.</p>

            <p>Jamal’s SharePoint expertise helps him identify the best way businesses can benefit from outsourcing their SharePoint management by constructing a solution to their exact specifications and 				requirements. Before he was architecting SharePoint solutions, Jamal was engineering them as a member of Fpweb.net’s Support Engineering Team where he provided real-time support for any 					SharePoint issue customers encountered. In Jamal’s spare time, he enjoys songwriting/ music production and he’s an active ASCAP member (The American Society of Composers, Authors, and 					Publishers).</p>
            <h3>Below is old job description data from LinkedIn</h3>
            <p>As a SharePoint Architect, I use my SharePoint expertise to identify how businesses can benefit from outsourcing their on-premise SharePoint environments and then develop a solution that is 				deployed to their exact business requirements and specifications . Prior to helping organizations save money via Cloud adoption, I was saving them time and internal resources as a SharePoint 				Support Engineer, working around the clock providing real-time phone and ticket support for any SharePoint/Connectivity issues customers encountered, so no automated systems ever got in the way. 				In both fields, my focus is customer satisfaction and building excellent long-term relationships. </p>

            <p>This month, we take a whole new approach to the classic webinar with our series <strong>“Steven &amp; Jamal Discuss the Cloud.”</strong> Don’t expect PowerPoint slides driven by monotone narration 			– we’re mixing it up with a 20 minute live presentation featuring our friendly Cloud experts, Steven Rupp and Jamal Pryor.</p>
            <p><em>(This webinar is currently available to view on-demand:&nbsp;<a title="Battle of the Clouds Webinar" href="https://www.fpweb.net/sharepoint-webinars/battle-of-the-clouds-public-vs-private-&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;cloud-hosting/" target="_blank">BATTLE OF THE CLOUDS: PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE CLOUD HOSTING</a>)</em></p>
            <p>Join us on <strong>June 27th, 2013, at 11:00am (ET)</strong> for the first ‘Fpwebinar’ as we present <strong>“The Battle of the Clouds: Public vs. Private”</strong> – an informal, educational chat 			about the differences between the shared cloud model and the dedicated cloud model. With a cloud computing market that Gartner predicts will reach <strong>$150 billion</strong> this year, 				businesses are making the shift to the cloud and Jamal and Steven show you which is the right fit for you.</p>
