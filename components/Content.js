                <p>“Sunshine” is synonymous with African drumming and dancing in East St. Louis.</p>

                <p>The nickname belongs to Sylvester Lee, who studied under legendary dancer and anthropologist Katherine Dunham before starting his own ensemble 40 years ago. He has taught thousands of children about their African roots and helped instill ethnic pride in a community that has faced its share of challenges.</p>

                <p>“I’ve taught five generations,” said Lee, who grew up in East St. Louis and now lives in Belleville. “I can tell you so many success stories. We’ve had teachers, superintendents, doctors and lawyers come out of this organization. We’ve had five dance companies come out of it.”</p>

                <p>Lee is 65 now, and some might expect him to be slowing down, but that’s not the case. He holds rehearsals two nights a week, leads workshops throughout the Midwest and travels with his Community Performance Ensemble, jembe drums in tow. Last year, they performed in Israel.</p>
